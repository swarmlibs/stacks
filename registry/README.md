This image contains an implementation of the OCI Distribution spec. See [github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec) for more details about what it is. You can find the full source code in [github.com/distribution/distribution](https://github.com/distribution/distribution).

## Recommended Reading

The [documentation](https://distribution.github.io/distribution/) is a good place to learn more about what the registry is, how it works, and how to use it.

Specifically, [the section regarding deployment](https://distribution.github.io/distribution/about/deploying/) has pointers for more complex use cases than simply running a registry on localhost.
